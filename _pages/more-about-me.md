In my free time, I like to play violin and rock climb!

Currently, I'm a first violinist in Carnegie Mellon University's [All University Orchestra (AUO)](http://alluniversityorchestra.org/). 

<!-- I have previously played in the University of Illinois Philharmonic Orchestra, Amazon Symphony Orchestra, California Philharmonic Youth Orchestra (CPYO), and Lynbrook Chamber Orchestra. -->

I love discussing economics, history, and philosophy, please don't hesitate to strike up a conversation :)
