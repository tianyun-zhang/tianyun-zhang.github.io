Hello! I'm a first year ECE PhD student at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/). I'm working on computer architecture research with Professor [Franz Franchetti](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~franzf/). 

Previously, I received a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Economics, with minors in Applied Statistics and Mathematics from the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/) in May 2023. I was a part of Professor [Saugata Ghose](https://ghose.web.illinois.edu/)'s research group at UIUC, working on processing-using-memory (PUM) architectures.

Research Interests
======
Currently I've been looking into: 

* Computer architecture
* Hardware-software co-design
* Processing-in-memory (PIM)

...and I'm open to doing more cool things!
